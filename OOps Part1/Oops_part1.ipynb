    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), self is a reference to the current instance of the class. It is used to access attributes and methods of the class within its own methods. The purpose of self is to differentiate between instance variables (attributes) and local variables within the scope of a method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few reasons why self is used in OOP:\n",
    "\n",
    "Instance-specific Access: Within a class method, self allows access to instance variables and methods. Since each instance of a class can have different attribute values, self ensures that the correct instance's attributes are accessed and manipulated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Method Invocation: When calling a method on an object (instance), Python automatically passes the object itself as the first argument to the method. By convention, this parameter is named self, but you can choose any name for it. Using self explicitly clarifies that the method belongs to the instance and not to the class itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clarity and Convention: Using self makes the code more readable and understandable. It's a widely accepted convention in Python and many other object-oriented languages. It clearly indicates that the method or attribute belongs to the instance rather than being a class-level or static entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instance Creation: During object instantiation, self is used to refer to the newly created instance. It helps in initializing the instance variables with the values provided during instantiation."
